The AMinco data contains data on the spectrum of the samples taken each week from the lake. 
A regression from ??? was used to estimate the relative abundance of phytoplankton species.


For the pigment data there are three types of files:

- CSV files (Aminco_1003-1805, Aminco_2505-0106, Aminco_1506-0308, Aminco_1008-1611). 
	These files contain the output from the aminco, 
	which is the fluorence of all pigments in the samples over a given wavelength (spectrum) 

- JNB files (Aminco_1003-1805, Aminco_2505-0106, Aminco_1506-0308, Aminco_1008-1611).
	These are sigmaplot notebooks on which the analysis were performed. 

- RTF files (i.e. Aminco_2809-3)
	These files contain the results from the pigment analysis. Each analysis was three times performed.
